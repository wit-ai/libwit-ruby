## API

### Overview

`wit-ruby` provides a Wit class with the following methods:
* `message` - the Wit [message API](https://wit.ai/docs/http/20160330#get-intent-via-text-link)
* `converse` - the low-level Wit [converse API](https://wit.ai/docs/http/20160330#converse-link)
* `run_actions` - a higher-level method to the Wit converse API
* `interactive` - starts an interactive conversation with your bot

### Wit class

The Wit constructor takes a `Hash` with the following symbol keys:
* `:access_token` - the access token of your Wit instance
* `:actions` - the `Hash` with your actions

The `actions` `Hash` has action names as keys, and action implementations as values.
Action names are symbols, and action implementations are lambda functions (not `Proc`).

A minimal example looks like this:
```ruby
require 'wit'

actions = {
  send: -> (request, response) {
    puts("sending... #{response['text']}")
  },
  my_action: -> (request) {
    return request['context']
  },
}

client = Wit.new(access_token: access_token, actions: actions)
```

### .message()

The Wit [message API](https://wit.ai/docs/http/20160330#get-intent-via-text-link).

Takes the following parameters:
* `msg` - the text you want Wit.ai to extract the information from

Example:
```ruby
rsp = client.message('what is the weather in London?')
puts("Yay, got Wit.ai response: #{rsp}")
```

### .run_actions()

A higher-level method to the Wit converse API.
`run_actions` resets the last turn on new messages and errors.

Takes the following parameters:
* `session_id` - a unique identifier describing the user session
* `message` - the text received from the user
* `context` - the `Hash` representing the session state
* `max_steps` - (optional) the maximum number of actions to execute (defaults to 5)

Example:
```ruby
session = 'my-user-session-42'
context0 = {}
context1 = client.run_actions(session, 'what is the weather in London?', context0)
p "The session state is now: #{context1}"
context2 = client.run_actions(session, 'and in Brussels?', context1)
p "The session state is now: #{context2}"
```

### .converse()

The low-level Wit [converse API](https://wit.ai/docs/http/20160330#converse-link).

Takes the following parameters:
* `session_id` - a unique identifier describing the user session
* `msg` - the text received from the user
* `context` - the `Hash` representing the session state
* `reset` - (optional) whether to reset the last turn

Example:
```ruby
rsp = client.converse('my-user-session-42', 'what is the weather in London?', {})
puts("Yay, got Wit.ai response: #{rsp}")
```

### .interactive()

Starts an interactive conversation with your bot.

Example:
```ruby
client.interactive
```
